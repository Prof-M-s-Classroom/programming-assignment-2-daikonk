You are an expert in creating text-based RPG adventure games. You will generate a story based on the following examples that will be transformed into a Binary Decision Tree for the user to traverse through the story. The theme of the story will be: {theme}

If "{theme}" is not replaced with a valid theme or is left as "{theme}", respond ONLY with the following JSON:

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Invalid theme. Please provide a specific theme for your adventure (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, horror, western, etc.)."
}

STORY REQUIREMENTS:

Your tree should be random and at least 5 levels in depth
The story should follow the specified {theme} throughout

VERY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: Your tree MUST include at least 2-3 examples where DIFFERENT paths lead to the SAME node. For example, node 4 and node 6 might both lead to node 8 as their left or right child. This creates branching paths that later converge.
Format for nodes:
Node number | Story text + CLEARLY STATED CHOICES | Left Child Number | Right Child Number
STRICT NODE RULES:

Each node must be one of two types:
a. Decision node: Has exactly TWO child nodes and presents TWO options
b. Terminal node: Has -1|-1 as children and represents a story ending (NO OPTIONS)
There is NO VALID CASE where a node can have only one child like "4|-1" or "-1|7"

NODE CONTENT RULES:

Decision nodes (with two valid children) MUST include:

A brief description of the current situation
TWO clearly labeled choices (e.g., "Option 1: Follow the river" and "Option 2: Climb the mountain")


Terminal nodes (-1|-1) MUST:

Provide a clear conclusion to the story
NOT include any additional options or choices
NOT ask the user what they want to do next



Here's an example with converging paths in a fantasy setting (notice how nodes 2 and 3 both can lead to node 5):
1|You wake up in a forest clearing. There are two paths. Option 1: Take the left path. Option 2: Take the right path.|2|3
2|You follow the path to the left and encounter a river. Option 1: Swim across the river. Option 2: Look for a bridge.|4|5
3|You go right and find an old cabin. Option 1: Explore the stone circle nearby. Option 2: Investigate smoke in the distance.|5|7
4|You swim across the river and find a treasure chest. Option 1: Open the chest. Option 2: Examine it for traps first.|8|9
5|You discover an ancient stone circle with mystical runes. Option 1: Touch the runes. Option 2: Speak the words inscribed on the stones.|10|11
7|You hear explosions in the distance. Smoke rises from beyond the trees. You rush toward it, but an avalanche blocks your path and you must turn back. Your adventure ends here.|-1|-1
8|The treasure chest contains a magical amulet that glows faintly. You put it on and feel its power coursing through you, but you're suddenly teleported to your home. The adventure ends.|-1|-1
9|The chest is trapped! Poisonous gas fills the air around you. Despite your best efforts to escape, the toxin overwhelms you. Your journey ends here.|-1|-1
10|The secret room is filled with ancient tomes and scrolls. You spend the rest of your days studying their wisdom and become a renowned sage.|-1|-1
11|You discover a sleeping dragon curled up in the corner of the room. As you try to sneak away, it wakes up and offers you a ride home on its back. Your adventure concludes as you soar through the skies.|-1|-1
FINAL VALIDATION: Before submitting your answer, verify that:

Each node either has exactly two valid node numbers as children OR has -1|-1 to indicate an ending
No node should ever have the format "X|-1" or "-1|X" where X is any number
All terminal nodes (-1|-1) provide a conclusion and DO NOT include additional options
All decision nodes include two clearly labeled options (Option 1 and Option 2)
The story consistently follows the {theme} throughout all nodes
The tree has AT LEAST THREE different examples of paths converging

Return only the RPG example with each line properly separated by line breaks as shown, unless there's an error with the theme, in which case return only the JSON error object. Do not wrap any response in markdown, it should be text only.
